# neurosurgeon

This is an incredibly niche piece of software that lets you poke around at the
pickled brain files generated by the discord bot "PriestBot", also written by
me and hosted on my server. It's a markov-chain-esque chatbot that says some
silly stuff sometimes, and this tool allows you to dig around in its brain and
see what it knows about certain words.
